Once a request has been submitted, `it must be approved`_ in the
“Request manager” module.

Requesting multi-copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to borrow multiple copies of a title (maybe for a book-club
or classroom use) you can request multiple copies of a title.

Once a request has been submitted, `it must be approved`_ in the
“Request manager” module.

Approve requests after they are made
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After requests have been made, staff need to approve the requests. The
approval process is built into the system because some libraries allow
patron initiated ILL requests through ShareIt. The approval process
allows staff to review any requests before they are sent to other
libraries to make sure the ILL request are in line with the borrowing
library’s ILL policies.
